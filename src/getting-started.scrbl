First, the easiest place to run Pyret is @url["https://code.pyret.org"], which
runs Pyret entirely within your browser.

If you're interested in a textbook, you can try out
@link["http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2015/" "Programming and Programming Languages
(PAPL)"], which has all its programs in Pyret.

You can follow a short tour of Pyret's features to get a feel for the language,

that you can follow to build up a simple animated game:
